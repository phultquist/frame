# Smart-Album-Cover
A Beautiful Display of Music

#### A Note About the Code
As of right now, the code contains both NodeJS files and Python files. Since I'm better in JS, I started by writing most in JS then switched to Python.

## About
This is a repository dedicated to the smart album cover display.

Running on a Raspberry Pi, this recognizes the live music playing and displays it on a 16x16 grid made with LED strips.

### The Software 

Python script records live audio, then uses the [audd.io](https://audd.io) service for music recognition.

Then sets the pixels to whatever the album cover receives.

### The Hardware
